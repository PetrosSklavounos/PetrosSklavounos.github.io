                    <h1>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION OF CHILLER UNIT CONSUMPTION</h1>
                </header>

                    <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <p>
                        The overall project objective was to evaluate the efficiency of a newly installed chiller plant by calculating its Coefficient of Performance (COP). The analysis involved a comparative study to determine whether operating the ice plant or the chillers was more cost-effective and energy-efficient.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>
                        The primary objective was to interface with excel data using a Python script to calculate the total power usage. This entailed sorting energy usage data into build and burn cycles, identifying active periods, and quantifying the total power consumed by each device. .
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Method</h2>
                    <p>
                        The method included the utilization of pandas for data organization and identification of active and idle periods within the energy consumption data. The script automated the process of calculating total power consumption for both cooling towers and air handling units during each cycle, providing a detailed breakdown necessary for COP analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Software and Tools</h2>
<p>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>pandas (Python Library):</strong> Utilized for data manipulation and analysis. Specifically, the pandas library was used to load the dataset from an Excel file, clean the data by dropping rows with missing values, and create a detailed log of chiller unit operations based on power consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Excel:</strong> Served as the source for the initial dataset and for visual checks of data post-processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Python Scripting:</strong> The core of the data analysis; this custom script interfaced with Excel data to track and optimize chiller unit operations, sorting energy usage into build and burn cycles, identifying active periods, and quantifying total power consumption for the cooling towers and air handling units during each cycle. This facilitated precise documentation and informed decisions regarding the efficiency of the chiller plant operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Matplotlib (Python Library):</strong> Employed for generating data visualizations to depict energy consumption patterns and operational efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The python script played a pivotal role in the project, providing automation for data analysis tasks that would otherwise be tedious and error-prone if done manually. It allowed for the efficient handling of large datasets and performed complex calculations needed to assess the COP of the chiller units.

                    <h2>Limitations</h2>
                    <p>
                        To capture the complete energy consumption of the system, more power usage values would be needed from equipment that did not have sensors on.
