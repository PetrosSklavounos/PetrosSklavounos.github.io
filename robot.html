							<h1>Product Development: "The Litter Robots"</h1>
						</header>
						<h2>Objective</h2>
						<p>The Litter Robots project aimed to address New York's waste management issue, with a particular focus on creating a viable solution. The team followed a structured approach, beginning with a compelling pitch akin to Shark Tank.</p>
						<h2>Project Description</h2>
						<p>Despite the challenges posed by the remote COVID environment, significant progress was made during the three-week timeframe. To establish feasibility, a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) was brainstormed and tested. In parallel, the team employed the Project Management software Miro to develop a comprehensive Business Model Canvas, encompassing the target customer, value proposition, revenue model, channels, and customer relationships. Validation of hypotheses was achieved through a series of more than five interviews conducted during the idea development phase.</p>
						<h2>Software Used</h2>
						<p>This project was developed using Miro for project management and Solidworks for design.</p>
						<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
						<p>Throughout the project, I developed my skills in project management and leadership. I learned to use crucial metrics for decision making and compromise, utilizing tools like decision matrices and Planning Poker. I also gained experience in using Miro, a project management software, which was instrumental in organizing our brainstorming sessions and developing a comprehensive Business Model Canvas. This canvas encompassed the target customer, value proposition, revenue model, channels, and customer relationships. I led the team in iterative refinement of the epic statement, sub-statement, and business model canvas, aligning the project with evolving customer needs and market demands. These refinements were based on insights gained from over five interviews conducted during the idea development phase. This project also enhanced my skills in leading a team in a remote environment, maintaining effective communication, and ensuring progress despite the challenges.</p>
